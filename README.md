# Smart Grocery

This is a full stack application called Smart Grocery. It is designed so that a person wanting to create a shopping list, they can add items to a list and also add aisles of where the items are in a supermarket.

This application allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete grocery items.

#General Approach

The backend was built using Ruby on Rails, I have set up the routes, controllers, models. I am using Postgress SQL as a database. In the front end I have set up Ajax to communicate with rails by passing in json.
